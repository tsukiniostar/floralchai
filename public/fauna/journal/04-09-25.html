    <h1>Noon sleep AKA siesta is not working for me</h1>
    <p class="date">★ 04 September 2025</p>
    <p>Those days if I couldn't take a good nap or can't sleep at noon is the most tiring. When napping I would have a lot of thoughts but after that, working in the afternoon is tiring! Super tiring to be exact. During siesta, my mind would flowing in ideas or words spoken out in my subconscious</p>
    <p>But after a nice shower I would feel super refresh, everytime like that it would motivate me to do works. I'm planning my ritual — steps to get back on track for work mode which is useful. I will dive deep into it more</p>
    <p><b>05/09</b> I sent 3 messages to 3 of my old literature teachers, I appreciated that all of them have replied and congrats me, they made my day and they seem happy about my success</p>
    <p>What I have focused on recently
        <ul>
            <li>Cornell method</li>
            <li>Color-code in note taking</li>
            <li>How to stop being afraid</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>What I want to work for the site
        <ol>
            <li>Some entries in media/flora page</li>
            <li>The Mean girls movie page</li>
            <li>A F2U website template for others</li>
            <li>Links, about me or site, translation pages? Maybe</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>End note</h2>
    <p>In the end, it is just me being productive, trying to set up my schedule, get on work mode. I have learned a lot and also spent a lot of time at home in the summer. But still during that time, I also go outside to walk or buy ingridients/food at nearby morning market. I would lock in more on this college semester as I made a promise to myself</p>
